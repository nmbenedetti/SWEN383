# Overall design
	## Package List
		*imageIO - This is our DataLayer and contains DataLayer Objects and access classes
		*UndoRedo - This holds the CareTaker and our Stack
		*AlterCommands - This is most of our command pattern. It holds objects needed to make and undo changes.
		*GUI - Contains the Graphical User Interface for our project
		*Default - We used this to hold our startup file, StartUpController.java
	## We wanted action to start in the default; data to come in from imageIO; imageIO to populate the GUI; and the AlterCommands to handle changes; the UndoRedo should handle these files.
